## About Documentation

Welcome to the Quartile OpenAPI documentation.
Currently, our apis are documented through endpoints.<br> 
For example: When going to [Developer Portal](https://developer.quartile.com){:target="_blank"} > API > Amazon, 
you will find text describing each endpoint and input/output data.

## About Tutorials
Tutorials is a simplified way on how you can use our API and have extra documentation.
